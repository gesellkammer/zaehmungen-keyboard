Should be used inside CsoundQt

**Needs**: 

* CsoundQt version >= 1.1.0 (download from https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/releases)
* csound version >= 6.18
       
**Hardware**:

* a MIDI keyboard with at least 67 keys

**NB**: although the csound patch should run in any platform supported by csound/csoundqt,
the patch has only been tested thouroughly under linux
